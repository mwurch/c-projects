My 42 Projects Repository
Welcome to my 42 Projects repository! Here, you'll find my implementations of various projects completed during my time at 42, including libft, get_next_line, minishell, and philosophers.

Projects:
1. libft
The libft project is the first project at 42, which involves creating your own C library containing re-implementations of standard functions, as well as additional useful functions.

2. get_next_line
get_next_line is a project focused on reading a line from a file descriptor. It teaches you how to handle file I/O and dynamic memory allocation in C.

3. minishell
The minishell project is about creating a simple Unix shell. It involves parsing commands, managing processes, and implementing basic shell functionalities such as redirection and piping.

4. philosophers
philosophers is an exploration of the classic dining philosophers problem. In this project, you implement a solution to the problem using threads (or processes) and synchronization primitives like mutexes or semaphores.
